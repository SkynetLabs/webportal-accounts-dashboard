  /**
   * It happened in the past that users subscribed via Stripe, but after coming back
   * to the dashboard they didn't see their subscription activated, so they subscribed
   * again (sometimes multiple times).
   *
   * The reason they didn't see their subscription activated in our dashboard is because
   * Stripe is notifying us about purchased subscriptions via webhook events.
   * If these events are delayed for whatever reason, dashboard has no way of knowing about
   * the purchase.
   *
   * To prevent users from attempting consecutive purchases, we'll show a warning saying
   * that the plan activation may take some time.
   *
   * We attempt to only show this warning to users this may relate to. It's not  a bullet-proof
   * check, but should take care of most situations:
   *
   *    - stripeCustomerId is populated when user accesses our Stripe checkout
   *      for the first time.
   *    - subscriptionStatus is populated only when we get a webhook call from Stripe
   *
   * We'll show the warning when stripeCustomerId was created, but subscriptionStatus is blank.
   * It may produce false positives, but we're fine with it for the time being.
